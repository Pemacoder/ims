                        <p>Choosing the right shoes color combination that matches the outfit you wear has a lot to do with your overall appearance. You can’t wear red casual shoes with formal pants and go to the office. Similarly, carrying black dress shoes with a pair of ripped jeans will be a fashion disaster. Isn’t it?</p>
                        <p>Even if you pair the apt type of shoes with your outfit, choosing the wrong color can also create a statement blunder. Are you now confused about the best shoes color combination to embellish your attire? This post will help you find the answer. Let’s dive into the discussion.</p>
                        <p>By paying close attention to matching pants with shirts, we often forget to coordinate our shoes with them. And that’s the place where color makes the difference. If you wish to carry a bold yet classy look, go for the combination of black-colored shoes over multicolored ones. Are you wearing blue casual shoes? Then, match them with bright-colored chinos, Khaki, or Grey.</p>
                        <p>Again, if you are carrying something bright on your feet, marry them with a neutral dress. Furthermore, teaming up your oxford or derby shoes with a matching belt can also make you stand out from the crowd. Although the search for outfit-coordinating footwear never ends, some shoe colors blend flawlessly with almost every ensemble. </p>

                        <p>Between work, gym, parties and more, shoes get that lingering odor off and on, which is either quite mind-boggling or very embarrassing. The smell is delivered by microorganisms as well as parasites that fill in the shoes and append to the skin. A few microorganisms really consume the top layer of the skin and creating a foul smell. Thus, a quick freshening-up exercise, to remove odor from shoes, is as important as to keep your shoes away from the bad smell.
                            So how to remove odor from shoes? How to remove the smell from shoes instantly, if you are party ready? Or how to get rid of smelly shoes by using some prevention methods?</p>
                        <p>Whether it is the leather shoes, wet shoe, boots, or for that matter any kind of shoes, microbes are the ones which are responsible for making shoes STINK! due to harboring moisture and thriving on the same. They fill in huge numbers on your feet, delivering natural acids — methanethiol, isovaleric acid and propanoic acid etc. and leave a lasting smell.</p>
                        <h3 class="text-dark">Use Baking Soda</h3>
                        <p>Since baking soda is a harmless cleanser and easily available at home, thus it perfectly answers the question of how to remove the smell from shoes instantly. All you need to do is take one part of baking soda, another part of baking powder and two parts of corn starch. Mix these in a cup, and put it either in socks to be kept inside the shoes or sprinkle this mixture inside your shoes. Leave this for 24 hours to get rid of smelly shoes. Save money on a freshener.</p>
